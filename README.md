# Connect Four

The classic connect four game, remade by me in 2015. Can be played human vs. human, human vs. AI, or even AI vs. AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, looking a certain number of moves ahead depending on the difficulty:
- Easy: 3-4 moves
- Medium: 5-6 moves
- Hard: 8-9 moves

Requires NetBeans to build, but a prebuilt jar is available in the dist folder.
